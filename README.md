## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **OpenCV**, **imageio**, **tqdm**
- A GPU for faster training (optional but recommended)
- **Jupyter Notebook** installed

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IGAN-Face-Generation.git
   cd IGAN-Face-Generation
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Jupyter Notebook:
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python tqdm imageio
```


# IGAN-Face-Generation

High-resolution face generation using **Image Generative Adversarial Networks (IGAN)** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

This project demonstrates how GANs can be trained to generate realistic human face images using a custom-designed Generator and Discriminator.
